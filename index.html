				There's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, "Why are we here?" and, "Where do we go?"
And, "How come it's so hard?"
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better togetherThere's no combination of words

Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better togetherThere's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, "Why are we here?" and, "Where do we go?"
And, "How come it's so hard?"
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together

We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
I believe in memories
They look so, so pretty when I sleep
When I wake up, you look so pretty
Sleeping next to me
But there is not enough time
There is no, no song I could sing
And there is no combination of words I could say
But I will still tell you one thing
We're better togetherThere's no combination of words
I could put on the back of a postcard
The song that I can sing
But I can try for your heart
Our dreams, they're made out of real things
Like a shoebox of photographs
Of sepia tone loving
Love is the answer
At least, for most of the questions in my heart
Like, "Why are we here?" and, "Where do we go?"
And, "How come it's so hard?"
It's not always easy and sometimes life can be deceiving
I'll tell you one thing
It's always better when we're together
Mmm, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, we'll look at the stars when we're together
Well, it's always better when we're together
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
And all of these moments just may find their way
Into my dreams tonight
But I know that they'll be gone
When the morning light sings and brings new things
For tomorrow night, you'll see
That they'll be gone soon
So many things I have to do
But if all of these dreams might find a way
Into my day to day scene
I'll be under the impression
I was somewhere in-between
With only two, just me and you
Now, so many things we got to do
Or places we've got to be
We'll sleep beneath the mango tree now
Yeah, it's always better when we're together
Mmm, somewhere in-between together
Well, it's always better when we're together
